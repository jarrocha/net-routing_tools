# Automating Quagga with QEMU-KVM
---------------------------------------

This script belongs to a post where it is explained how you can download your 
own Linux iso, configure it for Quagga, and build a script to easy bring up 
multiple virtual routers with QEMU-KVM.

This version is currently very on a basic stage for automation. Further work
will be done with it.
